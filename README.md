# 8051 Microcontroller in HDL

## Project Description

This github contains our 8051 design, the test code used to verify it and the physical hardware implementation. The main objective was to design an 8051 Microcontroller, using the Verilog code language, and finally to implement it in hardware using a Field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The procedure followed by the group will go through each step of the waterfall methodology.

  ### Our constraints
  
    • Use Verilog;
    • Use Xilinx Vivado.
      
## Work Areas
1. Processor Design
2. Hardware Description Language (HDL)
3. Defining a Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
